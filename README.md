# Analog Redstone
A set of gates that enable working with analog redstone signals.

## Information
Requires at least Forge 9.11.953 in order to work.

Currently only implements the Variable Switch, which is a switch with variable output (right-click the slider to turn up, shift+right-click to turn down).

Can be crafted by placing three cobblestone on the bottom row, then on the next row left to right: stick, redstone, wooden button.
